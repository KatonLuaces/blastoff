Workflow:

We used gitbub for issue tracking. Issues were opened during our meetings or by anyone who encountered a new obstacle. As our workflow evolved, we realized that issues should only be closed when tests created to represent the issue were passing. Much of our development was test-driven, creating tests regarding features and then using those tests as both the specification and the metric of progress.

We had weekly synchronous meetings on Saturdays beginning in mid-January continuing through the end of the semester. The meetings were all under an hour, primarily aiming to create consensus regarding design decisions. All other communications were asynchronous, primarily over instant message and comments in github issues.
We used Ocamlformatter with the Jane Street profile to unify the code standard.
