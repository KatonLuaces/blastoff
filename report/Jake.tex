I learned that it's very important to consider implementation when designing.  For instance, when writing the project plan/LRM, there were definitely a ton of small details I imagined that weren't that important, but potentially could cause a huge headache in implementation,  So be open to change, and try to be forward thinking in design!

I also learned that it's crucial that everyone is on the same page.  So that means let people do their work, but check out git commits, and read over people's code!  In fact, some advice that our group didn't do but could be really good is having a code review system.  It definitely would pay off in the long run.

I think the most important lesson I learned was that when you're excited about the langauge and the project, it doesn't feel like work.  There were points when I could work for hours on end without getting distracted just because I was excited about getting something functional, or writing up cool ideas for the language.  Having a project you actually think is cool will make it much more enjoyable, so when writing a project plan, try to think if you will actually enjoy working on this in three months.  However, equally important is being able to still work effectively when you're not excited.  When you're faced with a tough bug or an annoying problem is when determination counts the most.
