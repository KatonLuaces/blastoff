\section{Introduction}

Expressing an algorithm primarily through manipulation of matrices allows an implementation to take advantage of parallel computation. Graphs are one of the most important abstract data structures and graph algorithms underlie a wide range of applications. Yet many implementations of graph algorithms rely on sequential pointer manipulations that cannot easily be parallelized. As a result of the practicality and theoretical implications of more efficient expressions of these algorithms, there is a robust field within applied mathematics focused on expressing ``graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra"\cite{Kepner}. BLAStoff is a linear algebraic language focused on the primitives that allow for efficient and elegant expression of graph algorithms.
