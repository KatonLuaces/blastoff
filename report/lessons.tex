Katon Lessons Learned:
All issues should have a testing component attached to them. The issue isn’t resolved until a new test or set of tests that target that specific issue are created and pass.
I knew before that code that hasn’t been run yet is incorrect. But we found out that code in a language that has never been compiled is pseudo-code.
It is important to focus on fundamental issues rather than improving upon the few parts that work. Solving the fundamental issues is the most time consuming but also yields the highest reward.
Knowing how every part of the code base works, including those written by someone else, set-in-stone, and ostensibly error-free, is vital for debugging an error in any part of the code base.
Pretty printers aren’t just a nice demonstration, they are important for debugging and should themselves be tested.
