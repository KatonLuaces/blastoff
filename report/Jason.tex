\subsection{Jason}

I learned that my responsibility was not limited to my role as a tester. I learned that it was necessary to understand every part of the compiler, from parsing to semantics to code generation.
I had never done testing for a large or long-term project before. Thus, what I didn't understand at the beginning was that it wasn't my job to wait for my teammates to implement a feature and then write tests â€” it was my job to get ahead of their commits, and even their implementations, so that they knew what they were doing right and wrong. A comprehensive test suite leads a project.
Before I did this project, I thought testers were followers and language designers were leaders. However, I learned that both must lead in their own way.

My advice to the children out there is that discussing how your team's compiler works from end to end, and keeping yourself and everyone around you updated about that, is crucial to a successful project.
