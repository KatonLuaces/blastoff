One lesson I learnd was to push code as fast as possible so that my teammates would always be the ones stuck fixing the merge conflicts.

In terms of advice, I think one really important thing to do is to automate testing as much as possible from the beginning.

For example, because our compiler had to interface with a C library, there were a multiple commands we had to run just to compile and run some code in our language. At first, I was too lazy to write a script to automate this so I did it manually every time. I eventually started to hate my life so I wrote the script, and from then on, testing and debugging was a breeze. More generally, try to find your optimal workflow as early as possible. If you find yourself retyping commands over and over again, spent some time learning how to write bash scripts (it's not that hard!) and automate it.
